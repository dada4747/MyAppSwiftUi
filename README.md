# 🧩 Swift Modular Clean Architecture (MVVM-C)

This is a demo iOS app showcasing **MVVM**, **Clean Architecture**, **Coordinators**, and **Service Locator** in a modular setup.  
Each module (Home, User, Product) is fully independent and reusable in other apps.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Modularized structure (Home, User, Product modules)
- ✅ MVVM + Clean Architecture layers (Presentation, Domain, Data)
- ✅ Coordinator-driven navigation
- ✅ Service Locator for lightweight Dependency Injection
- ✅ Environment switching (Mock / Live APIs)
- ✅ Reusable modules across projects

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
The project follows a **Clean MVVM-C modular architecture**:

- **Coordinators** handle navigation.  
- **ServiceLocator** provides repositories, use cases, and services.  
- **Mock and Live services** can be swapped easily for testing.
